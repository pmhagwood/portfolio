# Portfolio Site Design

## Creative Portfolio Using CSS, Bootstrap, HTML5

This project showcases my knowledge of Bootstrap along with use of CSS and HTML5. 
I created three files, an about me page, a portfolio page which currently shows my illustration work, and a contact page. The contact page isn't fuctional at this time because our class has not covered how to get this to work.
